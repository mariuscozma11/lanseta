Think hard because this is for planning.

Help me plan and develop my app idea. The idea is an app for fishermen in Romania called "Lanseta". The app will be available on mobile and web so we should use react-native with expo for the frontend, and frontend build. And for the backend, to keep it simple we should use supabase(database auth and serverless functions).

MVP Features:
- Map of fishing spots(including rivers and lakes). We should add these manually, by sepcifing name, rules, description, price if it's a paid spot, species present and coordinates so we have map pins. This feature should be the main screen when opening the app.
- Solunar - daily and hourly fishing activity insights based on lunar phase and local sun times. Start with a simple, explainable scoring model that we can refine later. Or we can scrape/use an API if we find one
- Species database: besides name, description, we can show the best rigs/methods/baits and short guidance.

Target audience: Hobby anglers in Romania, for the MVP we can restrain to Timis county/Timisoara, so the initial language should be romanian.

The user account should benefit from a fishing journal where they can add the captures(type of fish, location, bait/method/rigs optionally).


We should also make a Claude.md with instructions so we ensure a constant behavior for further development
